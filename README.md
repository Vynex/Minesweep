### Gameplay 🕹️

Each cell in the board has three possible states, 'uncovered', 'covered', or 'flagged'. The board is generated once you click on an empty tile to prevent guessing. A set number of Mines are scattered throughout the Cells randomly which can end your game. To win, the player must uncover all non-mine cells.
